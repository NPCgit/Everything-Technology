  <p>I like technology(too much), and I play games, my favourite is Geometry Dash, and I also code!
    I am currently doing a coding course, and this is my project, but I also learn other progamming languages outside of the course!
    <br>Such as LuaU(Roblox Studio), and use software such as blender, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects.

  <h3>How to make a pc</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I mean, you probably want a gaming pc, so here is a cool guide. You can also use for content creation, so its pretty nice.</p>
  <br>
  <P></P>
  <h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h2>
    <p>For your information this is on gaming/content creation pcs</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is a guide on how to choose good parts for a PC</p>

    <h4>CPU</h4>
    
    <hr>
    <center><img id ="Image" src="amd-yd2600bb-oem-ryzen-5-gen2-six-core-2600-390ghz-socket-am4-cpu-no-cooler---only-for-sale-with-cpu-and-motherboard-bundle-or-a-falcon-custom-pc-system.jpg.jpg"></center>
      <p>So what is a cpu? It is kinda the brain of the pc, it calculates all the complex stuff(not graphical), such as:
      <br><b>Videos(but they could also rely on the iGPU)</b>

    </p>
    <br><h5>So how to I buy a good one?</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Avoid any procesor that has these words:
      <br>Celeron, Pentium, and Any non intel i series
      <br>There is also another brand named AMD:
      <br>Avoid the athlon and ryzen 3s from this manufacturer

      <br><h5>But why?</h5>
      <br><p>Because these are worse than the intel i3, which is good for gaming and decent at streaming(on a 12th gen or later)<br>
      Less than 4 cores without any hyper-threading is bad(example: 4 cores and 8 threads is hyper-threading)</p>
    </p>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <h4>GPU</h4>
    <hr>
    <center><img id="Image" src="OIP (30).jpeg"></center>
    <p>The above image is a graphics card, now what is it for?</p><br>
    <p><b>It is for displaying complex graphics(such as games and Ray Traced renders) </b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Now the above image is an RTX 3060, an entry level graphics card, for reference, gpu that can run all games at 1080p(high) is entry level, for 1440p(high) it is mid-range, and 4K/Ultrawide QHD(high) is for high end GPUs.
      There are 2 factors: VRAM and performance. Vram is like the memory for your CPU, but for Graphical rendering(such as gaming, higher count is better, but you also want fast vram). Try to get at least 12GBS for gaming.
      Now performance is also really important, FPS is how smooth it is, and higher(120+) is usually what you want.
    </p>

    <br>
    <center><img id="img-med" src="A4gKozZftqjB4EoGXPPGsY.jpg"></center>
    <br>
    <p>Now ths is a performance graph, this one compares an AMD to an nVidia card, it shows higher performance in these games because they don't have Ray Tracing/Upscaling on them, but AMD is still great for raw performance.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>But what if I have integrated graphics?</h4>
    <p>That's fine, if the only intense workflow you use is video editing software, the iGPU will boost the rendering performance by miles. If you play games, get a dedicated though(Amd for gaming ONLY, nvidia for intense workflows/upscaling/RT. This may make nvidia sound bad, but many people on youtube reccomend a budget gpu like a 6700XT, for examples such as its 12GBs of vram compared to the 3060ti/3070's only 8GBs of vram.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <center><img id="ram" src="71EXOwFSf-L._SL1500_.jpg"></center>

    <p>The above is a type of ram, for intense workflows, you will need 16GBs, but 8GBs or less is fine for word processing and browsing. The one above is great for gaming, and some intense workflows(If you get 2x8GBs or higher GB) But keep in mind that if you get AM5/LGA 1700, you will need a ddr5 version, which different sticks support different versions, most school computers use ddr3, some more powerful ones will use ddr4(also on gaming hardware), and ddr5(For those who are future proof)</p>
    <br><h4>What is DDR?</h4>
    <br>
    <center><img src="RamClock.png"></center>
    <p>DDR stands for double data rate, you can see here that it is almost 1600mhz, but because of that word "double", it is actually double that. 1600 x 2 = 3200.
      Some may be slightly slower, some slightly faster, on ddr4, the fastest i've seen is 4266mhz, but  on ddr5 there have even been 8000mhz ram, albeit very expensive. If you just want a PC that works now, i'd get ddr4, if you want one that is future proof, get ddr5 and an am5 motherboard. You can use it until 2025 and beyond.
    </p>
    <h4>My laptop/phone has lpddr, is that bad?</h4>
    <p>No, lpddr just means that its likely to be integrated, but uses less power(the LP stands for low power), often seen on laptops, phones, and apple products.</p>
    <div id="space"></div>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <hr>
    <center><img src="R (4).jpeg" id="img-med"></center>
    <p>The above is the popular 970 EVO PLUS, made by Samsung.</p>
    <p>That drive up there is just one type of storage. There are 2 different types of storage:<br>
    Mechanical storage i.e. a hard drive<br>
    Flash storage, such as the drive above.<br>
    There are a few types of flash storage: SATA storage(maxes out at ~500mb/s), NVME storage(maxes out at the pcie x4 generation, e.g. PCIE gen 4 maxes out at ~7500mb/s)</p>
    <br><p>If you are buying a laptop, the cheap ones use eMMC(max ~450mb/s, essentially an integrated SD card)</p>
    <div id="space"></div>
    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
      <center><img src="R.png" id="img-med"></center>
    <a style="font-size: 32px;" href="https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/">Use this</a>
    <h4>Why Tho?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Because I said so, if you've seen the link, you would know that the power supply above is an A-Tier one</p>
    <br>
    <p>I would recommend getting a corsair RM series unit, I have an RM650, and its too quiet, even when running [Insert super graphic intensive Rtx on no DLSS/FSR Intense raytracing game that probably requires a NASA PC].</p>

    <h2>CASE</h2>
    <center><img src="gabinete-gamer-corsair-4000d-airflow-mid-tower-com-fan-lateral-em-vidro-temperado-preto-cc-9011200-ww_1598453151_original.jpg" id="img-med"> </center>
    <p>Corsair 4000D airflow, great PC case. You should know I'm a Corsair fan now(no pun intended), they make good fans though! But Lian Li's are better for flagship pcs, you know showing off ur wealth. You NEED good airflow, you have fans in PCs, and you don't want them to suffocate from bad airflow!
      <br> For those on a budget, there are plenty of others! Just because you don't have a lot of money doesn't mean you have to get an ugly PC!

        <br><p>LianLi O11 Dynamic EVO, feels wrong to see this without a custom loop :'(</p></center>

        <br> <p>FYI, if these cases don't seem nice, it's not my bad taste of cases, it's google images, other than the 4000D Airflow and O11 Dynamic Evo, they truly are beautiful cases. PC building is like art, ya know...</p>

        <h2>Cooling</h2>
        <hr>
        <center><img src="thermalright-thermalright-peerless-assassin-black.jpg" id="img-med"></center>
          <br>
          <p>A cooler, again, recommended by tons of youtubers for its budget friendliness, etc... Bit of a shame my dad only lets me buy from [Not thermaltake, thermalright, lianli, EK, Alphacool, Heatkiller, And optimus, owait optimus waterblocks arent available here lol]</p>
          <br>
          <p>Got a little sidetracked, btw it's a THERMALRIGHT Peerless Assassin 120 SE, a lot of words.</p>
          <center><img src="OIP (1).jpg" id="img-med">
            <br><p>Overpriced Metal And Plastic that was once good in 2015</p></center>

          <br>
          <center><img src="R.jpg" id="img-med">
          <br>
          <p>Optimus FOUNDATION water block, for LGA 1200[10th, and 11th gen]</p></center>

          <br><p>When buying a cooler, see if it's quiet (less than 40dB), and has a decent max rpm, for watercooling, alphacool, optimus, and heatkiller, EK is overpriced metal and plastic. What if I don't want a custom loop? NZXT kraken elite 360.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <hr>
            <center><img src="81zNjdp8GzL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></center>
            <p>A b650 Motherboard, this one supports ddr5, because of the requirements of AM5, and the b650 chipset.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A motherboard must be compatible with your processor and your case, for a ddr5 motherboard, it would be nice to have pcie gen 5.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>But what is all this gobbledygook?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>PCIE is for peripheral connection: for high speed peripherals, such as a GPU, a wifi card, or PCIE to NVME storage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The speed of the PCIE connector won't effect the GPU much,  but will severly effect the wifi card, and nvme storage. For example, if you put a 10 gigabit network card in a PCIE gen 2(X1 slot), it would only give 4 gigabits(<a href="https://uk.crucial.com/support/articles-faq-ssd/pcie-speeds-limitations">Information on pcie speed(you will be able to work out x8 to x16</a>), for storage, if you put a pcie x4 gen 4 ssd(lengthened way of saying nvme ssd) in a gen 3 slot, it would only go to 4GB/s(same with PCIE X4 in X2)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dimm slots are for RAM, if you have DDR4, you need a DDR4 motherboard, if you have DDR5, you will need a DDR5 motherboard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>SATA ports are an older standard, originally ment for HDDs(~200-270mb/s), but slower SSDs(~550 mb/s) also use it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But for building a PC, you will need to connect all the wires to their specific location, and screw the stuff in. The hardest part: Connecting the 24 pin connector, and the HDD-led and PWR-led connectors. Unless if you want the PSU to fry itself, don't mix and match cable connectors, even if they're from the same brand. Extension Cables are fine though, because they connect to the end of the cable, not where you're supposed to plug it into the PSU(You only need to use this information if you have a semi/modular PSU)</p>

         <hr>
         <p>Whew, the end of that section, but a wild Other Section has appeared...</p>

         <br>
         <p><b>The Buying Guide</b></p>
         <br>
         <p><b>DO GET(used)</b></p>
         <br>
         <p>GPUs(Make sure to get 30 series and earlier, unless if you use jawa.gg if you're in the US)
          <br>
          CPUs
          <br>
          Motherboards(Your only choice for LGA 1200, or older), try to get one with an I/O shield.
          <br>
          Used RAM isn't that bad, because ram dies WAY slower than SSDS
          <br>
          Cases are alright, if it comes with all the cables(HDD-LED, PWR-LED, USB)
         </p>

         <center><img src="s-l1600.png" id="img-med">
        <br>
        <p>A used 2080ti, an alternative to the 3060ti</p></center>
        <br>
        <p>For used GPUs, get a 10-30 series nVidia card, or a RX 480-6000 series card(for the 480, just flash a 580 BIOS)</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="Lga1151 mobo.jpg" id="img-med">
        <br>
        <p>An lga 1151 motherboard, if you are flipping a PC, lga 1151 great! For yourself, it should be fine with a 4070 maximum(with a 9900K).</p></center>
        <p>It is recommended to get am4 or 1700 though, am4 is fine used, but if you think that you may upgrade the CPu in ~2 years, get am5(at the point of writing, zen 5 is believed to be ~30% performance boost, source: moore's law is dead)</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="71EXOwFSf-L._SL1500_.jpg" id="img-med"></center>
        <br>
        <h2>Why does ram last WAY longer?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          If a gen 5 ssd(~14000 mb/s), was used as the RAM, it would be quite slow(compared to DDR5, and slower than DDR4).<br>
          Also the RAM needs to constantly clear and write data, meanwhile a storage drive would be cleared much less often(by the user).
          <br>The SSD would not last very long, too, you see, a storage drive is tested for its TBW endurance rating, which will go down quickly if it is constantly writing files.
          <br>If you have seen the 1.5TB ram video by LTT, he would explain what SWAP is, and why it is painstakingly slow.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Cases, just clean them, same with used mechanical keyboard, membranes are a nightmare, because their keycaps aren't supposed to be removed by the user. They probably have all their cables, but if they don't, I wouldn't recommend getting it.</p>
